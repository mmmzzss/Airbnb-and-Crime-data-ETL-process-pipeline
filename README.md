# Airbnb-and-Crime-data-ETL-process-pipeline

In this project, we define a data analytics use case around the Aribnb and Crime data and engineer a data processing system using API, Spark, MongoDB, and Flask. 

<br>
Airbnb is a popular platform for travelers to book lodging in various locations across the world. However, when booking a listing in an unfamiliar area, it can be difficult to assess the safety of the neighborhood.<br>

<br>
This project aims to address this issue by developing a search engine that allows users to input the name of a listing or zipcode and receive crime information for the area.<br>
<br>
The search engine will serve for use in five major U.S. cities: <em>New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Austin, and San Francisco</em>. <br>


<br>

Here is the overall layout of the project:
+ Data ETL process pipeline
    + Front-end: API
+ Design of the back-end data warehouses
    + Spark, MongoDB
+ Interface to the designed system
    + Flask
